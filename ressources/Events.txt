You'll reach an old buoy.
This is where my ship sank.
Here be sharks.
You'll be above an old shipwreck.
Beware of the mermaids in this area!
There are reefs here.

#Coast
You want to avoid the crabs.
Avoid the quicksands on the left.
Coconuts!
Cross the creek.
A key is hidden under the root of the big palm tree.
Dig here, you'll find another map.

#Plain
Cross the river.
Under the tree here is buried my first mate.
Don't eat the berries from the bushes in this area.
Avoid the river, full of pirahnas.
Salted beef in a barrel!
The hanging tree...

#Forest
Beware of the traps!
You'll reach the cannibals village.
Under the mossy tree, you'll find an old bottle of rum!
Don't touch the sacred totem.
Don't disturb the monkeys in the trees.

#Valley
There is an old man in a hut, avoid him.
Under the piled rocks, I've hidden a key.
We put traps here, beware.
The valley of Snakes, we called it. Run.
You just reached our secret hideout!
Ten gallons of rums!

#Mountain
In the cave on the right there is a wild beast.
You will have to climb the cliff.
Follow the ledge.
Beware of rockfalls.
The slope is steep, but it'll be worth it.
Enjoy the view!
